In the beginning, there was [bare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-metal_server) [metal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2153/bare-metal). With the right software on the right computer, you could serve up any resource. Then, companies sprung up to offer managed hardware (so you don't have to). Companies like [MediaTemple](https://mediatemple.net/), [Rackspace]() had their own data centers and gave you "space on the server rack". Now we have thing like [AWS](), [Google Cloud] and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). I used to like Heroku but you know. Digital Ocean is too much $ for me, which is why I'm now running with [CloudFlare]().  Then again, if you love UNIX, you can always go for  [Super Dimension Fortress](https://sdfeu.org/w/).  My current favorites are: [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Render](https://render.com)
