In the beggining, there was bare metal. With the right software on the right computer, you could serve up any resource. Then, companies sprung up to offer managed hardware (so you don't have to). Companies like Media Temple, Rackspace had their own data centers and gave you "space on the server rack". Now we have thing like AWS, Google Cloud ans MS Azure. I used to like Heroku but you know. Digital Ocean is too much $ for me, which is why I'm now running with CloudFlare.
