The Module Federation plugin for Webpack 5, permits the implementation of architecture patterns that I've seen previously only on the back end.  Tools like containers and clusters, made necessary the use of multiple simultaneous systems, running on globally distributed hardware.  Knowing about the options for upgrading and adding features through software patterns such as the side car, made me wonder if the front would catch up as well.  The microservice paradigm makes taking a large enterprise level website, and to compartmentalize each section into it's own "Micro-Frontend", thus making the host page into a sort of platform for the other components.
