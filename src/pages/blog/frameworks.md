Frameworks are great, because they leverage the whole "standing on the shoulders of giants". I used to be surprised when another framework gets announced, and now I'm surprised if there isn't one every other day. Here's my list of all the frameworks I have ever come across:

1. Amber
2. Angular - and Analog
3. Astro!
4. Bun.sh (this is actually a new javascript runtime, as opposed to a "normal" framework)
5. CakePHP
6. Catalyst - Perl
7. Django
8. Dream - Ocaml
9. Enhance
10. 11ty
11. Flask
12. Fresh - Deno
13. Gatsby
14. htmx
15. Hugo
16. Lapis - Lua
17. Laravel
18. Lucky
19. Marko
20. Megento 
21. NextJS
22. NuxtJS
23. Phoenix - Elixir
24. Quik - QuikCity
25. Redwood
26. SolidJS
27. Svelte - Sveltkit
26. T3
28. Tanstack
29. Vue
30. Vite
31. Yew - Rust
32. [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesod) and the Jewish [Kabbalah]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah, Yesod is "the foundation upon which G-d has built the world." This is different, but it's still very good. It's written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), which has an asynchronous IO like Erlang. It produces fast compiled code in a constant-memory sort of way.  It has all the tools needed for developer productivity with type safety at compile time.
