Frameworks are great, because they leverage the whole "standing on the shoulders of giants". I used to be surprised when another framework gets announced, and now I'm surprised if there isn't one every other day. Here's my list of all the frameworks I have ever come across:

1. Amber
2. Angular - and Analog
3. Astro!
4. Bun.sh (this is actually a new javascript runtime, as opposed to a "normal" framework)
. Catalyst - Perl
. Flask
. Django
. 11ty
. Enhance
. Fresh - Deno
. htmx
. Marko
.
