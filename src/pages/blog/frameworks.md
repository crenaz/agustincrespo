Frameworks are great, because they leverage the whole "standing on the shoulders of giants". I used to be surprised when another framework gets announced, and now I'm surprised if there isn't one every other day. Here's my list of all the frameworks I have ever come across:

0. [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
1. [Amber](https://amberframework.org/)
2. [Angular](https://angular.io/) - and [Analog](https://analogjs.org/)
3. [Astro!](https://astro.build/) - This website is made with Astro! Written in javascript, but doesn't ship any javascript by default. 
4. [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) (this is actually a new javascript runtime, as opposed to a "normal" framework)
5. [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/)
6. [Catalyst](http://catalyst.perl.org/) - [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
7. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
8. [Dream](https://aantron.github.io/dream/) - [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/)
9. [Enhance](https://enhance.dev/docs/)
10. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
11. [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
12. [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) - [Deno](https://www.deno.com/)
13. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
14. [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
15. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
16. [Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/) - [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
17. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
18. [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org/)
19. [Marko](https://markojs.com/)
20. [Magento](https://www.magento.com) 
21. [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
22. [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)
23. [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) - [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
24. [Quik](https://qwik.builder.io/) - [QuikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/)
25. [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/)
26. [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)
27. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - [Sveltkit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
26. [T3](https://create.t3.gg/)
28. [Tanstack](https://tanstack.com/)
29. [Vue](https://vitejs.dev/)
30. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
31. [Yew](https://yew.rs/) - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
32. [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesod) and the Jewish [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah), Yesod is "the foundation upon which G-d has built the world." Well, this is something a bit different, but it's still very good. It's written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), which has an asynchronous IO like [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/). It produces fast compiled code in a constant-memory sort of way.  It has all the tools needed for developer productivity with type safety at compile time.
