I'll link the article here once I find it, but it was a piece in Forbes or Inc that was about how traditional college education might not be fast enough in certain fields. In the IT industry, for example, data analysis and systems programming are evolving at such a pace that tools and techniques are often outdated in less than a year. This article talked about how Google, IBM and Meta have developed their own curriculum to train people in skills that were needed (back then, before the layoffs at the start of 2023). I felt like this article was a bit of validation because I'm currently working through Google's UX Professional Certificate given on Coursera. Hopefully, programs like this will increase as education becomes more flexible and distributed to allow more people get the training they need.
