## The repo for my new site
~~Just to practice with Express Vue React on NodeJS.~~

Just gonna update this to reflect what I've doing. 

So, yeah; still using Astro.  It's really good.  Don't really like using this old html template.  Going to change to TailwindCSS because it will enable me to follow a more modern approach to best practices.


To do: update to a more modern flat look design or go with neo brutalism as described by Gary Simon from design course. 

TO DO:

  Switch(maybe) to Next13 and React18
  make same site in Angular
  make list of 'design styles' (ex. neomorphism, minimalism, brutalism)
