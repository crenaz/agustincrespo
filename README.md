## The repo for my new site
~~Just to practice with Express Vue React on NodeJS.~~

# Sat 10/29/2022 05:30pm

Just gonna update this to reflect what I've doing. 

So, yeah.  I'll be using Astro.  And using an old html template.  
To do: update to a more modern flat look design or go with neo brutalism as described by Gary Simon from design course. 

TO DO:

  Switch to Next13 and React18
  make same site in Angular
  make list of 'design styles' (ex. neomorphism, minimalism, brutalism)




  Here's the original ReadMe file just for reference: 


# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
